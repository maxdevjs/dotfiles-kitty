# Kitty terminal - one dark theme [~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf]

#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Fira Code
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. By default they are derived automatically, by the OSes
#: font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families that
#: have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For
#: example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 13.0

#: Font size (in pts)

# adjust_line_height  0
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

# cursor magenta
cursor white

#: Default cursor color

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

cursor_blink_interval      0
# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Note that numbers smaller than repaint_delay
#: will be limited to repaint_delay. Stop blinking cursor after the
#: specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to
#: never stop blinking.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

# url_color #0087BD
# url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

#active_border_color #282c34
active_border_color #A3BE8C

#: The color for the border of the active window

inactive_border_color #22262d

#: The color for the border of inactive windows

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred

inactive_text_alpha .6

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

active_tab_foreground   #282c34
active_tab_background   #abb2bf
active_tab_font_style   bold
inactive_tab_foreground #5c6370
inactive_tab_background #22262d
inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

foreground #abb2bf
background #282c34

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity         1.0
# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the default background color's
#: opacity. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost)

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #FFFACD

#: The foreground and background for text selected with the mouse


#: The 16 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version. You can also set the remaining colors from
#: the 256 color table as color16 to color255.
